# ng2-structured-seed

Angular2 seed with the following prioritized goals: 

- file names should describe purpose and type
- directory structure should be discoverable
- directory structure should be composable

#### Directory structure:

    + app
      + root
        + navbar 
          navbar.component.ts
        root.component.ts
      + shared
        + example
          example.component.ts
      main.ts (bootstrapping file)
    index.html
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
    typings.json
